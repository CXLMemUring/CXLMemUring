## Key Features Implemented

1. **Offload Operations**
   - Load operations with prefetching support
   - Physical address management
   - Cache eviction hints

2. **Graph Processing Support**
   - Specialized operations for edge and node access
   - Field-based node loading ("from", "to")

3. **LLVM Lowering**
   - Complete conversion patterns for all operations
   - Proper type conversion
   - Placeholder implementations for platform-specific features

4. **Pattern Recognition**
   - Basic pattern matching for graph traversal loops
   - Framework for automatic conversion from SCF to Cira

## Usage

1. Write MLIR code using Cira operations for graph processing
2. Use the `--convert-cira-to-llvm` pass to lower to LLVM
3. The framework handles offloading, prefetching, and cache management

## Next Steps

1. Implement runtime support for actual remote memory operations
2. Add more sophisticated pattern matching for automatic conversion
3. Integrate with hardware-specific offload engines
4. Add performance profiling and optimization passes
